# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project focused on understanding the spread, impact, and vaccination efforts related to COVID-19 across Kenya, India, and the United States.

##  Project Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Calculate and compare death rates and vaccination coverage across countries.
- Visualize data through bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and a choropleth map.
- Derive insights and patterns to reflect on the pandemic's global effects.

## ðŸ› Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda)
- **pandas** â€“ for data cleaning and manipulation
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** â€“ for data visualization
- **plotly** â€“ for interactive charts and choropleth map
- **Our World in Data** â€“ for the COVID-19 dataset

## How to Run or View the Project

1. Open `covid19_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda).
2. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.
3. To view the interactive map:
   - Open `death_rate_map.html` in your web browser (if included).
   - Alternatively, run the plotly choropleth cell in the notebook.

##  Key Insights & Reflections

- **Vaccination Coverage**: India showed the highest percentage of vaccinated population in the latest available data. USA data was incomplete for visualization, but still had significant figures overall.
- **Death Rate Trends**: Death rates varied significantly across countries, with India and the USA having higher absolute numbers but different patterns in growth rate.
- **Data Challenges**: Inconsistent or missing data (especially for the USA's vaccination metrics) posed limitations during visualization.
- **Visualization Tools**: Combining static and interactive charts provided more context to observed trends and allowed for better storytelling.
